***Sleepy Shooter***
--------------------
* 3D game
* I used AI agent tracking to keep the monsters chasing you. There's actually no escape.
* Tired kid DESTROYS monsters with facts. You basically run around killing toy monsters while barely conscious. 
* Improved camera script. Now the player can aim at anything in the scene, but the gun's line of fire remains aimed at the monsters. The game is simply impossible otherwise.

***RAPIDFIRE6***
--------------------
 *RapidFire6 is the 6th and only edition of the RapidFire series. Its is a modern 2D clone of Space Invaders. In particular, it goes crazy. The player,
represented by a spaceship, will be able to steer within the screen space using the left and right
arrow keys, while shooting lasers in the playspace.* 

* Used Shuriken Particle System to simulate combustions and fuel thrusters
*Enemies will fly in formation*
* Enemies will have an animation while in formation
* Enemies will be spawned outside the playspace and fly into their formation positions
* The background to the game will be animated and give the impression of being warped through space
through space
* When a projectile strikes an object, it will play a strike animation
* Mind the score..
* Sound will be generated by the following events:
 ○ player fires
 ○ enemy fires
 ○ player is destroyed
 ○ enemy is destroyed
 ○ player projectile strikes enemy
 ○ enemy projectile strikes player
* Background music will also play during the game which the player will have the choice of selecting
 
* Used Shuriken Particle System to simulate combustions and fuel thrusters

*I got a bunch of positive feedback about the 'trippiness' of the space scene..Play to see for yourself: <https://www.sharemygame.com/share/5c154e8c-cfad-48a8-b578-d453e8d5d260>*

***Ninja Ark***
--------------------
 *Ninja Ark is my first 2D game in Unity. The purpose of this game was to test the waters in Unity. It's kind of like an anime version of Arkanoid.* 

* Using a rasengan (spiralling blue ball), the objective is to destroy character sprites
* Once hit, the characters take damage until they uh well die.
* Yes, neji dies. (if you know you know)
* Background music goes crazy
* Lose scene is a bit scary from the feedback I recieved
* Actually, the win scene is also terrifying i dont really know why I made them like that
* Play: <http://www.sharemygame.com/share/a7c7b57e-d934-4403-8602-46dc651997a8>

***THE CURRY OF LIFE***

* 2D one player ballistics type game
* Created using Python's Pygame library
* Sprite class is inherited by the player and other sprite classes
* Implements the Game class
  * Game class makes the logic for restarting the game much more refined
* Uses sprites class to create groups of sprites and checks for sprite collisions

* *10 second timer, 60 spicy bowls of curry, unlimited chopsticks...*
